# MOON Clothing - 3D virtual fitting room

I have developed a 3D fitting room for an online clothing shop. This is my final year project. The fitting room allows the users to see a 3D view of their selected clothing item on a 3D human model. The human model can be customized into three sizes: S, M, L. Additionally, users can select the skin color for the model. Not only that, but users can also customize the selected clothing item by adding colors, logos, and text to it. By selecting their body size, users can get an idea of how the clothing item will fit on them. Moreover, by selecting a skin tone for the human model, users can decide which customized clothing item would best suit their skin color.
